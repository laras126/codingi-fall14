			Glover...puts impenetrably odd and tender poetry  on the screen.<br />

		<blockquote>
			Scenes with naked women in elephant masks, Shirley Temple, Glover being lowered deus-ex-machina style into a Maxfield Parrish scene...It's like Fellini on psychedelics – wildly creative but completely twisted.<br />
			<credit>–Jane Ganahl , San Francisco Examiner</credit> 
		</blockquote>

		<blockquote>
			It's unlike anything I've ever seen before...the unrestrained id of an artist at full frenzy, unafraid to mount onscreen what others would judiciously edit out. Glover's film is like that of the fever dream of a crazy person.<br />
			<credit>–Dennis Dermody , Paper Magazine</credit> 
		</blockquote>

		<blockquote>
			ABSOLUTELY the most uncompromising and original thing I've seen. People try to compare it to the likes of surrealist hero Luis Buñuel and trailblazer Werner Herzog, but I say Glover has transcended even them.<br />
