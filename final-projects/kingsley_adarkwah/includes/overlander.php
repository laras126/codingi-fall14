		&quot;Gregor’s luminous, supremely absorbing quest takes place in a strange underground land of giant cockroaches, rideable bats, and violet-eyed humans... Creature depictions are soulful and the plot is riveting... Wonderful.&quot;

		&quot;Collins does a grand job of world-building, with a fine economy of words…Unlike Gregor, who cannot wait to leave, readers will likely find [the Underland] to be a fantastically engaging place.&quot;

		&quot;The fast-paced, detailed narrative features vivid battle scenes (complete with gore), dangerous alliances, some frighteningly close calls, and the sobering death of comrades-in-arms. Cliffhanger chapter endings propel the story forward to its inevitable but nevertheless immensely satisfying conclusion, which, happily for readers, hints at more heart-pounding journeys to the center of the earth.&quot;
