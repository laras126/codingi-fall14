		<li> Of all the places Gregor could have traveled to, why the Underland? </li>
		<p>
			In 1991, Suzanne Collins began her professional career writing for children's television. She worked on the staffs of several Nickelodeon shows, 
			including the Emmy-nominated hit <em>Clarissa Explains it All</em> and <em>The Mystery Files of Shelby Woo</em>. For preschool viewers, she penned multiple stories 
			for the Emmy-nominated <em>Little Bear</em> and <em>Oswald</em>. She also co-wrote the Rankin//Bass Christmas special, <em>Santa, Baby!</em> with her friend, Peter Bakalian, 
			which was nominated for a WGA Award in Animation. Most recently she was the Head Writer for Scholastic Entertainment's <em>Clifford's Puppy Days</em>,and 
			a freelancer on <em>Wow! Wow! Wubbzy!</em> While working on a Kids WB show called <em>Generation O!</em> she met children's author and illustrator James Proimos, 
			who talked her into giving children's books a try.

		<li> Is there anything you find/found difficult or challenging in writing from the perspective of an 11-year-old boy? </li>
			<p>
				Thinking one day about <em>Alice in Wonderland</em>, she was struck by how pastoral the setting must seem to kids who, like her own, lived in urban surroundings. In New York City, 
				you're much more likely to fall down a manhole than a rabbit hole and, if you do, you're not going to find a tea party. What you might find...? Well, that's the story of 
				<em>Gregor the Overlander</em>, the first book in her five-part fantasy/war series, <em>The Underland Chronicles</em>,which became a New York Times bestseller. It has been sold into 21 foreign 
				territories.

		<li> Are you anything like Gregor? </li>
			<p>
				Her next series, <em>The Hunger Games Trilogy</em>, is an international bestseller. The Hunger Games has spent over six years to date on The New York Times bestseller list since publication 
				in September 2008, and has also appeared consistently on USA Today and Publishers Weekly bestseller lists. It has been sold into 56 territories in 51 languages. In 2010 Collins was 
				named to the TIME 100 list as well as the Entertainment Weekly Entertainers of the Year list.

			</p>

		<li> What kinds of things did you enjoy doing when you were 11? </li>
			<p>
				Lionsgate released a film adaptation of THE HUNGER GAMES on March 23, 2012, directed by Gary Ross who also shared screenplay credit with Suzanne and Billy Ray. It broke multiple box office 
				records and went on to become the 14th highest-grossing North American release of all time on its way to generating nearly $700 million at the worldwide box office. Lionsgate released the 
				second installment THE HUNGER GAMES: CATCHING FIRE worldwide on November 22, 2013, directed by Francis Lawrence from a screenplay by Simon Beaufoy and Michael DeBruyn and bringing back stars 
				Jennifer Lawrence, Josh Hutcherson, Liam Hemsworth, Woody Harrelson, Elizabeth Banks, Willow Shields, Paula Malcomson, Donald Sutherland, Stanley Tucci and Lenny Kravitz along with new cast 
				members Philip Seymour Hoffman, Sam Claflin, Jena Malone and Jeffrey Wright. It was the highest-grossing domestic box office release of 2013 and the 10th highest-grossing domestic release of 
				all time. Lionsgate will release THE HUNGER GAMES: MOCKINGJAY &#8211; PART 1 on November 21, 2014 and THE HUNGER GAMES: MOCKINGJAY &#8211; PART 2 on November 20, 2015, also directed by Lawrence. All four 
				films are being produced by Nina Jacobson of Color Force and Jon Kilik.

		<li> Many people think bats, rats, cockroaches, and spiders are creepy! Did you have to get over your fear of any (or all!) of them to write this story? </li>
			<p>
				In September 2013, Suzanne released a critically acclaimed autobiographical picture book, YEAR OF THE JUNGLE, illustrated by James Proimos. It deals with the year she was six and her father 
				was deployed to Viet Nam. It has been sold into 12 territories in 11 languages. Her first picture book, WHEN CHARLIE MCBUTTON LOST POWER, about a boy obsessed with computer games, was illustrated 
				by Mike Lester and came out in 2005. It has been sold into 4 foreign territories.

			</p>
		<li> Are you kinder to cockroaches, bats, rats, and/â€‹or spiders nowadays? </li>
			<p> 
				I don't think I was ever particularly unkind to them...but I do have more of a connection with them now. I'm more aware of their similarities to humans. And I'm sympathetic to their desire to survive, 
				which all creatures share.

			</p>
	
		<li> Did you have a sibling who, like Boots, got you into a world of trouble? </li>
			<p>
				I have two older sisters and one older brother and hold them largely responsible for the trouble I got into growing up. I believe as the youngest child, that is my right.
			</p>

		<li>  Have you ever lived in New York City? </li>
			<p>
				I lived in New York City for 16 years, from 1987 to 2003. But when I was growing up we moved all the time because my dad was in the Air Force. We were mostly on the eastern half of the U.S. and in 
				Europe but, like Gregor, I definitely know what it feels like to be a stranger somewhere.
			</p>

		<li> If you had to go to the Underland, what items would you take along with you? And who would you take with you? </li>
			<p>
				I'd take all the flashlights and batteries I could find. I'd also take a couple of bottles of water and chocolate, because I don't like traveling without either of these things. I would wear very comfortable clothes and sneakers...in case I had to run.
				My husband, Cap, would be great to have in the Underland, since he is very good in an emergency, but I'd want him to be with our kids up in the Overland so I'd know they were in safe hands.
				(Note: Cap says he would not take me to the Underland because I am not good in an emergency and I would constantly make him stop and ask for directions. Both of these things are true.)
				So I think I would take my good friend Christopher Santos with me, because he is very diplomatic and travels a lot and he seems at ease in foreign places. Also, he would never make loud, mean remarks about the creatures which could get a person in all kinds of trouble.
				In the Underland, I would make it my first order of business to hook up with a couple of bats because, let's face it, without a bat you're probably going to end up as someone's lunch.

			</p>

		<li> Have you ever been lost and wanted to find your way home? </li>
			<p>
				All the time. I have a terrible sense of direction. I get lost practically every time I leave my house. Fortunately, people are usually very kind about giving you directions if you ask politely.
			</p>

		<li> Do you think you were destined to be a writer? (or is there some free will involved?!) </li>
			<p> 
				I...have no idea how to answer this. I would have to go to a cave and meditate on it or something, and then I probably still wouldn't know.
			</p>

		<li> If you could invite one of the characters to have dinner with your family, who would it be? What might you cook for them?! What questions would you ask them? </li>
			<p>
				I would invite Ripred to dinner because I think he would tell the most interesting stories. We would have to serve shrimp in cream sauce because this is his favorite dish of all. Just to irritate him, I would tell him he has to use a napkin&8211;or he won't get dessert. He would use the napkin, because dessert would be a fabulous chocolate cake and he loves food, but I bet he would glare at me the whole time.
				I would ask all kinds of questions about being a rat, and living alone in the Dead Land, and about his family. Ripred sometimes sneaks up to the Overland, so I would ask him his opinion of New York City, too.
				After dinner, we'd play Scrabble.
			</p>

		<li>  All fun aside for a moment, Gregor is also about war and battling forces and survival. Can you tell us a little bit about this?" </li>
			<p>
				Gregor falls into a fantastical world, but he's really acting out the main role in a war story. Almost as soon as he arrives in the Underland, he's recognized as the &quot;warrior&quot; of the prophecies and he's called upon to undertake what are essentially a series of military missions. For instance, in Book I he goes into enemy territory to rescue 
				a prisoner of war who also happens to be his dad. It's never described as such, but that's what's really happening.
			</p>

			<p>
				As the series continues, Gregor is faced with increasingly difficult quests and choices as the Underland breaks into a massive global war. His struggle to survive-both physically and spiritually-forms the arc of The Underland Chronicles.
